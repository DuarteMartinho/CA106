        <img src="Images/goal.jpg" height=168px width=250px"/>
        <p1>To score a point(goal) in football you must make the ball in its entirety cross the oppenents goal line inbeween the posts and under the crossbar.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1>This may sound easy at first but is actually quite diffucult to achieve as the player must deal with the opposin teams defense and the goalkeeper while keeping other rules in mind such as handballs, offsides and fouls.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="Images/handball.jpg" height=168px width=250px"/>
        <p1>In football like the name suggests the ball is to be kicked for scoring and passing and no player on the field may touch the bal with their hands except for the goalkeepers.</p1> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p1>An exception to this is the ball to hand rule where if the players hand is in a natural position by his side and the ball is to accidentaly touch the players hand then no foul will be awarded.</p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Images/foul.jpg" height=168px width=250px"/>
            <p1>A tackle foul occurs when a player in possesion of the ball is kicked anywhere on his person opposed to the ball, this is a major rule to ensure the safety of players and why shin gaurds must be worn.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other interations of this is a tackle that involves two feet, from behind or with intentional malicous intent, the general rule of thumb is that if it looks like a foul, it probably is.
