        <p1>Although the game has been played for millenia the first competitions began in the late 1800's with the first "FA cup" being run in 1871 with a match the following year happening between england and scotland which ended 0-0 with 4,000 people attending at hamilton crescent! </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1>It took 12 years after this for the first international competition to take place which occured between England, Irelan, Scotland and Wales. Football was for a long time mainly played in Britain but would gradually spread to european countries but took till 1867 for the first game to take place outside of europe in Argentina but was played by British workers and not Argentinian citizens.</p1>

        <img src="Images/1930 world cup.jpg" height=168px width=250px"/>
        <p1>Footballs biggest competition first took place in 1930 and was the very first FIFA World Cup which was hosted in Uraguay, 93,000 spectators watched the final game on July 30th as Uraguay defeated Argentina 4-2, labelling them the worlds best. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The large number of 93,000 is very little compared to the 1.1 billion people who tuned in to watch the latest 2018 world cup where France beat Croatia 4-2! </p1>
            <br>

            <img src="Images/modern football.jpg" height=168px width=250px"/>
            <p1>The modernised game today is very differnt to football in the past as it has become the most spectated and largest game in the world with players and teams earning large sums of money as the once past time sport has become a large business played by the highest level of athletes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today the Football brings in 20 billion euros in revenue worldwide with players being transfered between teams for sums as big as 222 million euros!
