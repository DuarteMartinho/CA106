                    <h2>Jiu Jitsu Belt System</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Belt System is a far stricter than in most other martial arts. It can take upwards of 10 years to achieve the black belt. As there are only a few belts, you will spend a long time on each one. Also, your progress will not be linear. You will spend weeks or months on plateaus before being rewarded with a jump in ability. Sometimes it will actually seem as if you are getting worse instead of better. But the plateau is actually your friend and is itself an indicator of progress. It is those who have the mental strength to keep going when they find themselves on a plateau that break-through to a higher level of ability. Several years ago, black belt Roy Harris wrote a good article detailing what was expected at each belt. I have extrapolated on this and provided a breakdown of what I expect from my students at each belt. No matter what, remember to enjoy the process. Donâ€™t be too focused on achieving the next belt or winning competitions etc.

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong> White Belt: </strong>White belt is the beginning rank for all Brazilian jiu-jitsu students. The rank is held by any practitioner new to the art and has no requirements. Some instructors and other high-level practitioners think that a white belt's training should emphasize escapes and defensive positioning since a white belt will often fight from inferior positions, especially when training with more experienced people. Most academies will additionally require that a white belt level practitioner works to obtain a well-rounded skills set, with a knowledge of basic offensive moves, such as common submissions and guard passes.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Blue Belt:</strong> Blue belt is the second adult rank in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. At the blue belt level, students gain a wide range of technical knowledge and undertake hundreds of hours of mat time to learn how to implement these moves efficiently. Blue belt is often the rank at which the student learns a large number of techniques.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Purple Belt: </strong>Purple belt is the intermediate ranking in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The purple belt level practitioner has gained a large amount of knowledge, and purple belts are generally considered qualified to help instruct lower-ranked students.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Brown Belt: </strong>Brown belt is the highest ranking color belt below black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Progressing from a beginner white belt through to a brown belt typically requires at least five years of dedicated training. It is often thought of as a time for refining techniques.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Black Belt: </strong>In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the black belt denotes an expert level of technical and practical skill. BJJ black belts are often addressed within the art as "professor", although some schools and organizations reserve this title for more senior black belts.</li>
