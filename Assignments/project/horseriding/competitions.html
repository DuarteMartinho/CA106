            <p>
                There are many types of competitions across the world for each <a href="./typesofriding.html">Type Of Riding</a> as each sport is different.
                
            </p>
            <h4>Show Jumping</h4>
            <p>
                For Show Jumping the most well known are the Grand Prix and Six-Bar.
                <br>
                <br>
                Grand Prix: 
                This is the highest level of show jumping. Runs under International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) rules, the horse jumps a course of 10 to 16 obstacles, with heights up to 1.6 meters tall and spreads of up to 2.0 metres wide.
                Grand Prix level show jumping competitions include the Olympics, the World Equestrian Games, and other series of internationally ranked events. 
                Grand Prix show jumping is normally referred to as only the best can compete.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six-bar: 
                Riders jump six fences set in a straight line, in most places, fences are placed at equal distances apart, the first fence is the lowest and each subsequent fence is higher than the one before. 
                Horses either are penalized or eliminated from competition if they knock down a rail, depends on the competion.
                After each round where more than one competitor goes "clean"/"clear", or is tied for the fewest faults, the six fences are raised in height for each subsequent round until there is a winner. 
                Occasionally, if there are multiple jump-offs, the final fences may be raised.
            </p>

            <p> Every year Ireland has the Dublin Horse Show, it consists of mostly Show Jumping</p>

            <h4>Cross Country</h4>
            <p>
                For Cross Country there is not a specific competition as it is normally part of a show so it would be linked with Show Jumping and Dressage.
            </p>
            <h4>Dressage</h4>
            <p>
                For Dressage the most well known are the Grand Prix, Olympics, World Cup and World Equestrian Games.
                Apart from competition, there is the tradition of classical dressage, in which the traditional training of dressage is pursued as an art form. 
                The traditions of the masters who originated Dressage are kept alive by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Cadre Noir in Saumur, France. 
                This type of schooling is also a part of Portuguese and Spanish bullfighting exhibitions.
