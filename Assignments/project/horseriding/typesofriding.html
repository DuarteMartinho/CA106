                <br>
                There are a lot of styles for the jumps, like:
            </p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>

        <section id="crosscountry">
            <h3>Cross Country</h3>
            <p>
                Cross Country is an endurance test that forms one of three phases of the sport of eventing. 
                It is not as common but can be a competion in its own right. 
                Cross-country courses for eventing are held outdoors through fields and wooded areas.
                The terrain is unique for each course, which usually incorporates the course into the natural terrain of the area.
                <br>
                The Cross Country course is approximately 6 KM long, with around 20 to 36 obstacles. Obstacles can include all those that might be found if riding across the countryside, including water, trees, logs, ditches, and banks.
                <br>
                Conditioning is an essential part of preparing a horse for cross-country. Although the lowest levels may not require anymore riding than the usual 5 or 6 days each week used to train the horse, all upper level horses are placed into strict conditioning programs.
                <br>
                There are a lot of styles for the jumps, like:

                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td><img src="./images/Water.jpg" alt="Water"></td>
                </tr>

        <section id="dressage">
            <h3>Dressage</h3>
            <p>
                Dressage itself is a way of training and riding your horse. 
                There are many different equestrian disciplines of horseback riding from classical dressage, western riding, through to jumping, reining and eventing to name a few.
                Dressage itself is an Olympic discipline and it is enjoyed all around the world through the various levels with Grand Prix being the highest level that is performed internationally and Grand Prix musical freestyle being the real crowd pleaser as this is where the movements are performed to music.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h5>Points System</h5>
            <p>
                The dressage tests are performed in a 20 meter x 60 meter arena with a smaller arena being used at some levels. Within the test there are separate movements that flow from one movement to the next, each movement is marked from 0-10. 10 being excellent, 5 sufficient and 0 no movement was performed. 
                At the end of each test, the dressage judge also gives four general impression scores for the performance. 
                All the points are then added and divided by the total possible score to give a percentage mark for that test performed by horse and rider.
