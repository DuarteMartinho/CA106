                    <h2>Jiu Jitsu</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling and submission holds.
                        It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one’s opponent,
                        gaining a dominant position and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.
                        On the right, you will a find a video giving a basic insight into Jiu Jitsu and how it works. 
                        <br>
                        <h2>Modern martial art with ancient roots</h2>
                        <p>The word “Jiu Jitsu” derives from the Japanese “Jū” meaning “gentle” and “Jutsu” meaning “art” essentially Jiu Jitsu is the “gentle art”. <br>
                            <br>
                           Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a predominantly ground-based martial art, using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge of the human anatomy, 
                           in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one’s opponent. Unlike other martial arts that focus on strikes and/or kicks, jiu jitsu focuses on close-contact “grappling” holds and techniques,
                           and the application of chokes and joint-manipulations.</p>

                    <h2>Starting Jiu Jitsu</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        The most important thing to achieve when starting jiu jitsu is to find a good school.
                        You’ll want to make sure the instructor is knowledgeable, friendly and supportive, 
                        and that the gym culture is supportive and open rather than closed or cult like. 
                        On the right, you will a find a video giving a basic insight into Jiu Jitsu and how it works.
                        There are a few other telltale signs of a good gym including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A large percentage of regular students are coloured belts</li>
                            <li>The instructor is friendly and supportive of students</li>
                            <li>The gym is convenient for you in terms of location and timetable</li>
                            <li>The gym caters to your goal e.g self-defence, competition</li>
                          </ul>

                        <br>
                        <h2>The Average Class</h2>
                        <p>Jiu jitsu gyms around the world might organise classes differently, but the average BJJ class will be comprised of:<br>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong> Warm ups (10 – 15 minutes): </strong>These can include a short jog around the mat, stretching, and individual or partner exercises like squats, forward and backward rolls, hip escapes and more.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Technique & Drilling (30 – 40 minutes):</strong> The instructor will teach a technique or series of techniques, usually as part of a series over the course of a number of weeks or months. Students will learn the technique, practice with their partner, and then be taught extra details, set ups for the technique and/or finishes for the technique which they continue to practice with their partner. </li>
                                <li>The gym is convenient for you in terms of location and timetable</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Sparring (15 – 30 minutes): </strong>Students start sparring or “rolling” regular rounds (usually five minutes per round) starting with their initial partner and then moving onto other partners in the gym. Sparring rounds are unscored, so submissions signal a reset until the time ends.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong> Cool down (5 – 10 minutes): </strong>Some gyms will also have a cool down after the sparring rounds.</li>
                            </ul>
