            <h2>What are eSports?</h2>
            <p class="rcorners1">
            eSports, short for Electronic Sports, is a form of competitive sport for people that play video games on a professional level.
             We all love to play video games, be it as a hobby or just to release some stress from our daily lives. 
             However some people who are looking for a bigger challenge and decide to up the difficulty decide to go to a professional level and compete against others for prizes.

            <h2>Team Work</h2>
            <p class="rcorners1">
            Teamwork in gaming is a very common thing.
            Although meeting new people and getting to know them can be rather intimidating,
            this is not the case in online video games.
            As people are anonymous when playing people are more relaxed which makes it easier to communicate with others.
            On a professional level teamwork is essential.
            Typically people tend to work together when they have something in common, be it nationality or hobbies. 
            This is most commonly seen in the eSport teams as most teams are formed from people of the same nationality and represent their countries when playing these tournaments.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p class="rcorners1">
            To some, hosting a major event such as this may seem unprofitable, however,
            these competitions are streamed online to millions of viewers and families at home.
            From these streams fans can donate money for certain perks and prizes, 
            not only that but these tournaments are always sponsored by big companies which helps to improve the gaming community to support the professionals.
