                    <h2>Benefits of Jiu Jitsu</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Exercise: </strong>Jiu Jitsu sparring rounds (also called rolls) are generally five minutes in length, and include a variety of low and high intensity efforts with little rest. This makes Jiu Jitsu sparring a great form of exercise. According to our estimation based on research carried out on Jiu Jitsu athletes, 30 minutes of hard rolling could burn approximately 500 calories. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Challenging:</strong> There’s a deceiving amount to learn in Jiu Jitsu, starting with basic positions, sweeps, transitions and submissions. There’s a huge amount of techniques you could potentially learn, and because no one opponent is exactly the same, you’ll be forced to constantly adapt which of these techniques you use. That’s just the technique portion. Then there are the subtle concepts embedded within jiu jitsu like balance, leverage, framing and more. It’s unlikely you’ll run out of new things to learn in Jiu Jitsu.. </li>
                            <li>The gym is convenient for you in terms of location and timetable</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Self Defence: </strong>Jiu Jitsu teaches you valuable self defence skills, particularly how to restrain opponents, ground survival techniques, and submissions designed to render an opponent unconscious or immobilise them using locks and holds.  It has demonstrated a high utility in MMA, so if you plan to learn and compete in MMA, it’s a useful addition to your arsenal.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Sparring: </strong>Jiu Jitsu is an interesting martial art because of the regular opportunities to spar and “test” your techniques and hypotheses against a resisting opponent. Most classes will include 15 – 30 minutes of sparring broken up into 5 minute rounds where you can spar with opponents of different weights and skill levels. This means you’re constantly going up against different people with different game styles, and must constantly refine and change up your game.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Fun: </strong>Above all else, Jiu Jitsu is difficult but fun. The first time I pulled off a successful submission in training I was elated. When your game plan comes off perfectly, or you roll with a trusted training partner and mix in some healthy trash talking you’ll realise just how much fun it is.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                    <h2>Mental Benefits</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Patience: </strong>In Jiu Jitsu you’ll often have to wait for the best time to make an escape or bait an opponent. When trying to escape, especially when wearing a gi, you’ll need to patiently defeat each of your opponent’s obstacles before successfully making an escape.  
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Discipline:</strong> Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is mentally and physically challenging. To continuously make it to class each week consistently requires discipline in the face of regular and normal “losses” in sparring. As mentioned above, this is important for growth.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Pressure: </strong>One of the biggest lessons I learned when starting jiu jitsu was to relax, especially when in an unfavourable position where your first reaction might be to panic. Relaxing under pressure allows you to better conserve your energy and plan your next move. In a study of 42 male Jiu Jitsu athletes from Norway, Øvretveit et al. wrote “Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners appear to focus on mastery, making them more likely to demonstrate adaptive behaviour when facing adversity.”</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong> Confidence: </strong>After training in Jiu Jitsu for an extended period of time you’ll have an impressive list of successes when sparring or competing which will help build confidence. You’ll also eventually progress in rank and prove that you can survive on the mats. The self-defence benefits of jiu jitsu might also help to inspire confidence when you’re out of the gym.</li>                                <br>
                            <li><strong> Stress: </strong>I’ve personally entered my gym on numerous occasions with stress or after experiencing a bad day. Everytime I step off the mats later that night after some sparring, I feel mentally clear and often forget what I was worried about in the first place.</li>
