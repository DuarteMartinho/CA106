1
Portugal was were I lived for most of my life. 
<br>
There I learned a lot of stuff and that is where I grew up half of my life. 
<br>
I still have some family over there which is nice to go see them.
<br>
I can see a big difference from Ireland to Portugal specially on the food, culture and the weather.

Computers is somethings I am interested in and I enjoy playing games and talking to friends. <br>
Now-a-days we are able to do anything on a computer like work, research information, and communicate with people far away.

Programming has been something I have been interested in since I was young as my grandad and my uncle are in the same area.
<br>
Since young I watched them make games, websites and programs.
<br>
So since a few years I have been self teaching myself on how to program.
